1. include and require
    include is used when another file contains the variables that are required in current files. and if not found then the program should continue without any errors.

    require is similar to include but if it doestn't find the file, then it returns error.

    the only difference between require and include other than the spelling is that, include shows only warning whereas require shows error when the file is not found.

2. file handeling
    good to know things:
    AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
    CSS = Cascading Style Sheets
    HTML = Hyper Text Markup Language
    PHP = PHP Hypertext Preprocessor
    XML = EXtensible Markup Language
    SQL = Structured Query Language
    SVG = Scalable Vector Graphics


    readfile() : it is a function that read and write it to the output buffer.
